It’s OK.</p> <blockquote>Attribution is appreciated but not required.</blockquote> <p>We’d prefer people buy our playbooks &amp; eBooks, but if they want to share with friends, they have every right to do so.</p> <p>Thanks to <a data-ng-href="{{linkPrefix}}{{pageLinks.hack}}" analytics-on>Dad</a>, <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/" title="Self Improveusnt fir Smart People" target="_blank" analytics-on>Steve Pavlina</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://leobabauta.com/" target="_blank" analytics-on>Leo Babauta</a>&nbsp;for this.</p> <h3><span style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.4">Why We’re Releasing This Work</span></h3> <p>We’re not a big fan of copyright laws, especially as they’re being applied by corporations, used to crack down on the little guys so they can continue their large profits.</p> <p>Copyrights are often said to protect the creator, but in most cases the artist gets very little while the corporations make most of the money. In the 15+ years that Dad's been working in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source#Society_and_culture" target="_blank">open source culture</a>, with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" target="_blank" analytics-on>GNU</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank" analytics-on>Creative Commons</a> works - he knows that releasing copyright will not hurt us, the creator of the content, code or creative works, a single bit.</p> <p>We think, in most cases, the protectionism that is touted by “anti-piracy” campaigns and lawsuits and lobbying actually hurts the artist. Limiting distribution to protect profits isn’t a good thing.</p> <p>The lack of copyright, and blatant copying by other artists and even businesses, never hurt Leonardo da Vinci when it comes to images such as the Mona Lisa, the Last Supper, or the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvian_Man">Vitruvian Man</a>. It’s never hurt Shakespeare. We doubt that it’s ever really hurt any artist (although we might just be ignorant here, but Dad doubts it).</p> <p>If someone feels like sharing our content on their blog or in their book, or in any other form for that matter, that’s a good thing for us. If someone wanted to share our stories with 100 friends or 1000 users, we don’t see how that hurts us. The same goes for all images and digital media we create (unless there licesnes attached to specific images). Our work is being spread to many more people than we could do ourselves. That’s something to celebrate, as we see it.</p> <p>And if someone wants to take our work and improve upon it, as artists have been doing for centuries, we think that’s a wonderful thing. If they can take our favorite creations and make something more funny or more inspiring or more thought-provoking or even life changing … we say more power to them. The creative community only benefits from derivations and inspirations.</p> <p>This isn’t a new concept, of course, and we’re freely ripping ideas off here. Which is kinda the point.</p> <h3>Questions & Actions</h3> <p>There are a number of objections that will likely be brought up to this concept, and here are a few of our responses:</p> <p><strong>1. You’ll lose revenue</strong>. If people buy our books or eBooks and then distribute it to 20 people, and each of those distributes it to 20 more, and those to 20 more … we've lost $76,000 in eBook revenues. Perhaps. That’s if you agree with the assumption that all those people would have bought the eBook if it hadn’t been freely distributed. We don’t buy that. In this example, thousands of people can now read our work who wouldn’t have otherwise. That’s good for any content creator.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>2. Who knows what people will do with your work?</strong><span> Someone could take our work, turn it into a piece of crap, and put our name on it. They could translate it with all kinds of errors. They could … well, they could do just about anything. But that kind of thinking stems from a mind that wants to control content … while we are of the opinion that you can’t control it, and even if you can, it’s not a good thing. Or more likely, what if they take the work and extend the concepts and make it even more useful, to even more people? Release control, and see what happens. People are wonderful, creative creatures. Let’s see what they can do.</span></p> <p><strong>3. What if someone publishes a book with all your content and makes a million dollars off it?</strong>&nbsp;Ha! Then congradulations! We never made a million dollars from it. We hope they at least give us credit. And our deepest desire is that they give some of that money to a good cause.</p> <p><strong>4. But … they’re stealing from you!</strong>&nbsp;You can’t steal what is already given freely. This is called sharing, not piracy.</p> <p><strong>5.
