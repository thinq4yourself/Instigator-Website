## Overview

In every traveling family's life, there is a thorn. Managing web presence is one of ours. So we're trying a new approach, having our own website not built in a CMS,
to showcase some of our creative work and story telling. Thanks to [yaboi](https://github.com/yaboi/Passion-Driven-Website) for the boost and initial codebase...and for being [Ya Boi](http://beardandfedora.com).

## Under The Hood (Core Features)
In order for you to follow your passion, you have to **G**et **Y**our **SHI**t **DO**ne. To [GYSHIDO](http://gyshido.com) with code, you need to work smarter.
